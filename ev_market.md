# Proposed Analysis Outline & Data Sources

Below is an outline of the planned analysis, organized by section. For each major topic we list the key data/metrics to gather, the likely sources, and preliminary assumptions for forecasting. We will follow the specified structure (global + China, US, EU (w/UK), India; 2019–24 historical + 2025–30 forecasts; base and downside scenarios).

- **Scope & Deliverables**: Two-page executive summary (with one main chart) and an ~8-page appendix with detailed tables, charts, methodology, and fully cited sources. Raw data (CSV/XLSX) will be provided for all charts/tables. Currency=USD, metric units, distance in km (per assumption).

- **Overall Approach**: We will compile historical sales/stock data from IEA, industry reports and national registries; segment by BEV/PHEV and key classes; project forward using adoption curves informed by policy and cost assumptions. Base forecasts will align with recent IEA/BNEF outlooks, while a downside scenario will assume slower adoption (e.g. policy uncertainty, slower cost declines). All assumptions (battery cost declines, oil price, incentive phaseouts, vehicle lifetimes, charger rollout rates, etc.) will be documented explicitly in the methodology section.

## 1. Market Size & Growth (Global + China, US, EU/UK, India)
- **Metrics**: Annual new vehicle sales (ICE vs EV) and EV share (BEV+PHEV) for 2019–2024; year-end total EV stock. Compute CAGRs (2019–24) and project 2025–30.
- **Data Sources**: 
  - **IEA Global EV Outlook** (2023/24) for global totals (e.g. **2023 ~14 M EVs** sold; **18%** share of new cars ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars/#:~:text=Almost%2014%C2%A0million%20new%20electric%20cars1,growth%20remains%20robust%20as%20electric))).
  - **BloombergNEF Electric Vehicle Outlook** for historical and forecast data (notes from Axios: BNEF sees EVs at **33% share by 2027** ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/12/electric-vehicle-demand-bnef#:~:text=should%20increase%20the%20production%20of,EV%20sales%20by%202030))).
  - **Regional**: China – CAAM or MIIT reports, EV-Volumes.com; US – DOE/AFDC registrations or Polk/Ford Motor Company data (e.g. ~620k EVs sold in US 2022); EU – ACEA/ACEA plug-in registration stats; UK – SMMT; India – SIAM/FAME India figures (noting gaps).
  - **Proxies** if needed: Use IEA or BNEF regional breakdowns to fill missing years; cross-check with Reuters/FT/AutoNews figures.
- **Prelim. Assumptions**:
  - Base: Follow “Stated Policies” trajectory. Eg. **Global EV share** ~25% by 2025 (IEA), rising to ~40–50% by 2030. China share ~35–40%, US/EU ~30–35% by 2030 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/d797f5af-f65a-4430-8de6-53d2c71a3023#:~:text=adoption%2C%20with%20significant%20implications%20for,down%2C%20aiding%20global%20market%20expansion)). 
  - Downside: EV share notably lower (e.g. global ~25–30% by 2030) due to policy reversal or slower cost reductions (e.g. Axios notes US EV outlook reduced) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/global-ev-sales-iea#:~:text=day%20in%202024%20from%20a,ongoing%20economic%20and%20policy%20uncertainties)).
  - Where data gaps (e.g. India EV stock), note explicitly and use informed estimates (e.g. FAME targets, CRISIL forecasts).

## 2. Segmentation
- **By Propulsion**: Breakdown of EV sales/stock by BEV vs PHEV (and note HEV/FCEV if significant).  
  - **Sources**: IEA Outlook (often gives BEV/PHEV split), EV-Volumes (country model data). China: NEV list from government. 
  - **Note**: In many markets BEV dominates EV stock (IEA: 70% of EV stock in 2023 were BEVs ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars/#:~:text=more%20than%20the%20annual%20total,electric%20car%20stock%20in%202023))).
- **By Price Tier**: Define “mass” vs “mid” vs “luxury” (e.g. <$30k, $30–60k, >$60k).  
  - **Sources**: Vehicle price data from OEM/MSRP lists, national registration stats or market reports (e.g. average transaction price, Edmunds, JATO, or McKinsey market segmentation).  
  - **Assumption**: EV price premiums over ICE will shrink; more mid-market EV launches by mid-2020s. We will approximate segment shares using average selling prices (sources: JATO Dynamics, industry press).
- **By Vehicle Class**: Focus on passenger cars vs LCVs; mention buses/trucks as context.  
  - **Sources**: IEA data on EVs in LCVs/buses (if available), or OEM press (e.g. BYD, Volvo for buses). US/EU heavies have minor EV share <1% through 2030. We'll note limited penetration of heavy EVs by 2030 (outside China).

## 3. Demand Drivers & Adoption Factors
- **Incentives/Subsidies**: Catalog major purchase incentives (e.g. US tax credits [IRA], EU subsidies/bonus-malus, China NEV subsidies phased to 2022, India FAME II).  
  - **Sources**: Government/IEA summaries of EV policy. For example, ACEEE or IEA policy database. 
- **Non-monetary Incentives**: HOV lane access, toll rebates, parking.  
  - **Sources**: EV associations, policy reports.
- **TCO Analysis**: Compare total cost of ownership EV vs ICE (fuel + maintenance + depreciation) for representative vehicles.  
  - **Sources**: BloombergNEF or McKinsey TCO studies (e.g. BNEF’s EV Index), ACEEE/EPA studies. E.g. BNEF reports EV TCO parity in Europe by ~2025. 
- **Fuel & Electricity costs**: Amortize typical fuel vs electricity prices.  
  - **Sources**: EIA (gasoline), IEA/NRCan (EV charging rates). Use current prices (~$3–4/gal, electricity ~$0.13/kWh US avg; adjust for regions) and forecast scenarios (oil $70-100).
- **Barriers**: Summarize range anxiety, charger access, model availability.  
  - **Sources**: Consumer surveys (MIT/Toyota studies, Deloitte Global EV Survey) and infrastructure stats. E.g. mention ~14% charging stations gap to 2025 targets (IEA).

_Assumption Example_: Assume **battery pack costs** continue to fall ~7%/yr (from ~USD100/kWh in 2022 to ~USD60–70/kWh by 2030) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/12/electric-vehicle-demand-bnef#:~:text=should%20increase%20the%20production%20of,EV%20sales%20by%202030)), narrowing EV premium; oil price ~US$75/bbl (sensitivity ±$20). Incentives gradually phase out by late-2020s per current policies.

## 4. Supply Side & Manufacturing
- **EV Production Capacity**: Identify announced gigafactories and ICE-to-EV retoolings (e.g. Tesla NV Gigafactory expansions, Volkswagen battery Plants in EU/US, BYD/XPeng in China).  
  - **Sources**: BloombergNEF, S&P Global Platts reports on gigafactories, OEM investor presentations.  
  - **Data**: Estimate each region’s EV assembly capacity (constraint on growth).
- **OEM Market Shares**: Global top EV sellers (Tesla, BYD, VW, SAIC/GM, Hyundai/Kia, Stellantis, etc) and regional leaders.  
  - **Sources**: IEA, EV-Volumes, company 10-Ks. We will compile 2023 EV sales by company (IEA or counter) for top 8 globally, and top OEM per region (e.g. Tesla in US, BYD in China, VW in EU).
- **Battery Supply**:
  - *Cell Production (GWh)*: Global and regional installed capacity (China ~50% of global, etc).  
    *Sources*: BNEF Battery Outlook, WoodMac reports. 
  - *Leading Cell Producers*: CATL (~30% market, China), LG Chem, Panasonic, BYD, SKIE (Sohn et al.).  
    *Sources*: Industry rankings (Benchmark Mineral).
  - *Cell/Pack Cost Trends*: Historical $/kWh downtrend (e.g. $1,000 (2010) → ~$135 (2022)), projected (BNEF shows ~$80 by 2025 ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars/#:~:text=Almost%2014%C2%A0million%20new%20electric%20cars1,growth%20remains%20robust%20as%20electric))).  
    *Sources*: BloombergNEF battery cost charts, DOE (NREL) data.
- **Raw Materials**:
  - Track lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite price trends and supply/demand.  
    *Sources*: S&P Global CRU data, USGS Minerals Yearbook, IEA. Note concentration: LT plates (Australia/Chile), Co (Congo), processing (China). Quantify e.g. “Lithium prices up X% since 2020 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/83fae6485077278a093321c9830e5219#:~:text=2023,6))”.
  - **Supplier Risk**: % of global supply from top 3 firms (e.g. Chinese refineries control ~80% of battery chemicals). Will highlight any “single point of failure” (e.g. DRC cobalt).

_Assumption_: Continued investment in battery capacity so cell supply keeps up with EV growth (we will validate against announced GWh vs forecast demand). Battery pack cost to decline ~6–8%/yr (as above). Raw material prices volatile: assume moderate stabilization (supply expansions meet demand by late 2020s).

## 5. Charging Infrastructure & Energy
- **Public Chargers**: Number of AC (Level 2) vs DC fast chargers by region (2019–2024).  
  - **Sources**: IEA Global EV Data Explorer; US DOE AFDC database (US station counts); EU Commission or national agencies (ACEA/EAFO) for EU; China EV charging forum. 
  - Compute per-capita and per-EV ratios (e.g. chargers per 100 km road). 
- **Grid Readiness**: Note constraints (peak load, grid upgrades).  
  - **Sources**: Utility pilot programs (PG&E V2G trials, UK National Grid EV readiness plan). Summarize e.g. California’s grid integration issues (CAISO reports).
- **Charging Times/Costs**: 
  - Typical 50kW DC (~30 min/200 km), 150kW (~10-20 min); home charger (7kW, 5-7 hr overnight).  
    *Sources*: Manufacturer specs, ChargePoint/Sema data. 
  - Pricing: e.g. fast DC ~ $0.30–0.60/kWh back-of-mouse, home ~ $0.10–0.15/kWh.  
    *Sources*: State/regional tariffs, EVgo/ChargePoint pricing.

_Assumption_: Public charger installations grow ~30%/yr, but still trailing EV uptake. Include typical utilization rates (e.g. a DCFC sees ~1-3 sessions/day at present). Will present plausible revenue models (e.g. $\$0.25$/kWh, 400 kWh/month per charger).

## 6. Regulatory & Policy Environment
- Summarize key measures per region:
  - **EU**: 2035 ICE ban (100% ZEV sales), CO₂ targets for 2025/2030, national incentives.
  - **US**: Federal tax credits (IRA, up to $7500, available until 2032), California/NE states ZEV mandates, fuel economy rules.
  - **China**: New Energy Vehicle quotas/credits (10% by 2025 target), subsidies phased out by 2022, license plate restrictions favor EV in cities.
  - **India**: FAME II subsidies (through 2024), higher taxes on ICE vehicles, state EV policies.
- Future policy changes:
  - Collect announced/planned shifts (e.g. China tightening NEV credit ratio, US potential rollback under new admin). 
  - **Sources**: Government/regulatory websites, IEA policy list, NGO trackers.
- **Policy Timeline**: We will create a timeline table (2019–2030) of major EV-related policies (dates of ICE ban announcements, incentive expiries, fuel standards).
- **Assumption**: Unless otherwise noted, assume announced policies remain in effect. Downside scenario may assume delays (e.g. EU shifts end-date, US cuts credits early).

## 7. Economics & Business Models
- **OEM Profitability**: Compare EV vs ICE gross margins.
  - **Sources**: Corporate filings (Tesla’s gross margin ~20% svc, others 15%; GM cites lower ICE margins). Analyst reports (Morgan Stanley, Bernstein) on EV margin pressure.
- **Aftermarket/Services**: Qualitative:
  - Additional software/ADAS revenue per car (McKinsey Digital Auto report), battery leasing or second-life markets (IEA notes increasing interest).
  - Adoption: note current % of OEM revenue from services vs expected growth (e.g. 10–15% of total).
- **Charging Business Models**: 
  - Station economics: assume capital cost ($100k for DCFC), utilization (e.g. 2 charges/day avg), pricing ($/kWh).
  - **Sources**: Industry benchmarks (Spotlight by Delta-ee, EVBox). 
  - Discuss revenue streams (charging fees, subscriptions) and unit economics (payback period at X cars/day).
  
_Assumption_: EV manufacturing has slightly lower per-unit margins initially (higher battery cost) but lower variable costs (fewer parts). Charging networks break even at moderate utilization (~20% hours). 

## 8. Competitive Landscape & Strategy
- **Incumbent OEMs vs Pure-Play EVs**: 
  - Global market share of brands in EV segment (Tesla ~15% global EVs, BYD ~12%, VW ~…) using IEA/EV-Volumes data. Identify strengths (Tesla software/brand) and weaknesses (incumbent slower integration of EV architecture).
  - Recent strategic moves: e.g. VW’s multi-billion € investment in Spain gigafactory, GM Ultium partnerships, Toyota’s EV push after years of HEV focus.
- **New Entrants**: Profiles of top EV-only companies:
  - NIO, Xpeng, Rivian, Lucid, etc – market niche, production volumes, funding (combine news/filings). 
- **Platform Strategies**:
  - OEM platfoems: VW MEB, EV/BEV architectures (Stellantis STLA, Toyota e-TNGA plans).
  - Partnerships/JVs: e.g. Ford-VW collaboration, Stellantis-Toyota van JV (if any), battery JVs.
- **Implications**:
  - E.g. “Western OEMs need scale: recommend consolidation in charging across brands, local battery supply to avoid tariffs.” 
  - (To be fleshed in final recs.)

## 9. Risks & Scenarios
- **Key Risks**:
  - *Upside*: Faster battery innovation (solid-state), stronger policy (renewed ICE bans), high oil prices driving EV TCO advantage.
  - *Downside*: Policy rollback (US subsidy cuts, EU delays), slower battery cost decline (mining bottlenecks), economic downturn reducing car purchases.
- **Scenario Outlines** (quantitative):
  - **Base Case**: Continuation of current policies. EV share of new sales ~40–45% globally by 2030 (China ~45%, EU/US ~35%). Global EV stock grows to ~~100 million~~ by 2030 (based on IEA projections). 
  - **Downside**: Policy pullback/slower growth. EV share ~25–30% by 2030 globally. EV stock only ~~60 million~~. Battery cost only falls to $80/kWh (vs $60 in base).
  - **Upside (optional)**: Aggressive shift (carbon pricing, tech breakthroughs): EV share ~55% by 2030.
  - We will present: Clarity of assumptions (e.g. in downside no new subsidies + slower charging deployment; in base stable incentive taper).
- **Quantification**: We’ll illustrate these in charts/tables (e.g. % EV vs ICE sales under each scenario).

## 10. Charts/Tables (Planned Outputs)
- **Key Chart for Executive Summary**: Projected EV sales and EV share through 2030 (global + major regions). Data from base-case forecast.
- **Appendix Figures**:
  1. **Historic EV Sales & Share (2019–24)** by region: Data table + mini chart. Source: aggregated from IEA/BNEF/national.

  4. **TCO Comparison Table**: EV vs ICE for representative segments (e.g. compact car, midsize SUV, small LCV) in US/EU/China for 2024 and 2028 (including purchase, fuel, maintenance, resale). (Source: BNEF, McKinsey, IEA data).
- **Data Files**: We will supply CSV/XLSX for each chart/table (e.g. “EV_sales_historical.csv”, “EV_forecast_scenarios.csv”, “Battery_cost_trend.csv”, “TCO_data.csv”).

## 11. Methodology & Assumptions
- **Forecast Method**: 
  - *Trend Extrapolation*: Fit recent CAGR to 2030 with adjustments for policy. 
  - *S-curve Adoption Model*: (Optional) for mature market limit.
  - We will align base-case with an average of IEA and BNEF scenarios (“Net Zero” vs “Stated Policies”).
- **Key Assumptions** (to be documented in Appendix):
  - **Battery Cost**: ~USD100/kWh (2022) → $70/kWh (2030) in base; slower drop to $80 in downside.
  - **Oil Price**: ~$75/barrel real ($70–80 range baseline). 
  - **EV Price Premium**: 20% now → 5% by 2030 (mass-market vehicles).
  - **Vehicle Lifetime**: 15 years average (for stock calculations).
  - **Charging Rollout**: Public charger base grows ~30%/yr; home charging adoption ~30% of EV buyers per year.
  - **Policy**: No new major incentives beyond those announced; EU 2035 ICE ban stands.
  - **Economic Growth**: moderate GDP growth (2–3% global).
- **Scenario Differences**:
  - Base vs Downside vary by: policy support, cost declines, EV launches. For example, base scenario retains full EV incentives (US IRA, China credits), downside assumes major incentives expire by mid-2020s.
  - We will tabulate all quantitative assumptions (battery $/kWh, EV price, etc.) per scenario in Appendix.
- **Data Gaps**: Any missing data (e.g. incomplete EV stock data for India) will be noted; we may interpolate or use proxies (e.g. SIAM sales plus assumed scrappage to estimate stock).

## 12. Timeline & Quality Control (for Project Management)
- **Timeline**: Initial outline (this document) prepared by [Date]. First draft with placeholder charts in ~7 days. Final deliverable (executive summary + appendix + data files) ~3 days after feedback.
- **Quality Control**:
  - Ensure all figures in charts/tables sum logically (regional sums = global).
  - All data points in the summary will be traceable to cited sources. We will use inline citations (e.g. [IEA 2024], [BNEF 2023]) in the draft and compile a full bibliography in Appendix.
  - Verify proprietary data usage: if we use any paywalled report data, we will replicate underlying numbers and cite the report/page.
  - Explicitly list all assumptions (battery cost growth, incentive expiry, etc.) in the methodology.
  - Attach CSV/XLSX of raw data for each figure; label with sources.
  - A QC checklist will be included in the final appendix per instruction.

**Clarifications/Scope**: We will focus primarily on passenger vehicles (cars and LCVs) as the core market; heavy trucks/buses will be mentioned briefly as low-volume segments. If a deeper dive into commercial EVs is desired, that can be added based on feedback. 

**Next Steps**: Proceed to data collection from the identified sources and begin building the charts/tables. Please advise if any section should be added or scope adjusted.
