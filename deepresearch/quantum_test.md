Addresses B/J: showing that roadmap to scalable FTQC may be much less resource-intensive than previously thought under optimistic decoders and connectivity.

**None of the above references is paywalled** (all arXiv or open-access). No missing data was encountered; if any paywalled journal is essential, we will source the author preprint. In particular: (i) all relevant data (thresholds, fidelities, error rates, etc.) will be meticulously extracted from these sources (figures/tables), (ii) their assumptions (noise models, gate sets) will be noted. 

We will proceed to collect detailed quantitative data from each (error rates, code parameters, lattice size, etc.), then synthesize and compare them as per the project outline. If any expected key paper is identified as missing, or if any cited work lacks sufficient detail, we will flag it. 

**Access note:** All the above are available via arXiv or institutional repositories; no access issues. (If needed, we may request links for any final published versions, but initial review can use the preprints.) 

**Next steps:** We will analyze these 20 papers in depth, extract quantitative metrics into a spreadsheet, and begin drafting the report sections as specified. We will provide numerical tables (e.g. core parameters from each work) to compare approaches.
