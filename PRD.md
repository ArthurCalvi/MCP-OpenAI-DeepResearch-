# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## MCP Server for OpenAI DeepResearch

### Project Overview

**Product Name:** MCP-OpenAI-DeepResearch Server  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** September 13, 2025  
**Owner:** Arthur Calvi

### Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates OpenAI's DeepResearch API, enabling agentic systems like Claude Code and Codex to perform comprehensive research tasks efficiently. The server will expose DeepResearch capabilities as an MCP tool, allowing AI assistants to autonomously conduct multi-step research, synthesize information from web sources, and generate citation-rich reports.

### Problem Statement

Researchers and knowledge workers currently face several challenges:
- Manual research processes are time-consuming (hours vs. minutes with automation)
- Information synthesis across multiple sources requires significant effort
- Citation tracking and verification is labor-intensive
- Agentic AI systems lack efficient access to comprehensive research capabilities

### Solution Overview

Build an MCP server that:
- Exposes OpenAI DeepResearch as a callable tool for AI assistants
- Provides structured research capabilities with configurable parameters
- Handles authentication and API management seamlessly
- Returns formatted, citation-rich research reports

### Target Users

1. **Primary Users:**
   - Researchers in finance, science, policy, and engineering
   - Knowledge workers requiring thorough, precise research
   - AI developers building research-enabled applications

2. **Secondary Users:**
   - Students conducting academic research
   - Content creators requiring fact-checked information
   - Professionals making data-driven decisions

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Functionality

**FR-1: DeepResearch Tool Implementation**
- Implement as MCP Tool (not Resource or Prompt)
- Expose single research function callable by AI assistants
- Support both `o3-deep-research-2025-06-26` and `o4-mini-deep-research-2025-06-26` models

**FR-2: Input Parameters**
The tool must accept the following parameters:
- `context` (string, optional): Background context about the research query
- `query` (string, required): Detailed research question/topic
- `research_depth` (string, optional): Research thoroughness level (LLM-defined, e.g., "comprehensive", "focused", "surface-level")
- `domain_restrictions` (string, optional): Domain limitations (LLM-defined, e.g., "academic sources only", "recent news articles", "technical documentation")
- `output_format` (string, optional): Preferred output structure (LLM-defined, e.g., "detailed report", "executive summary", "bullet points", "technical analysis")

**FR-3: Configuration Management**
- JSON-configurable MCP server settings
- Required configuration:
  - `openai_api_key`: OpenAI API authentication
  - `model`: Choice between available DeepResearch models
- No additional configuration options (keep minimal)

**FR-4: Output Handling**
- Return structured response compatible with MCP protocol
- Include full research report with inline citations
- Preserve OpenAI's citation metadata and source links
- Format output according to specified `output_format` parameter

**FR-5: Error Management**
- Raise appropriate MCP errors for:
  - Invalid API keys (authentication errors)
  - API failures or timeouts
  - Rate limiting responses
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Invalid parameter combinations
- Follow MCP error handling patterns using ToolError for user-facing issues

#### Technical Requirements

**TR-1: Technology Stack**
- Python 3.10+ implementation using FastMCP SDK
- OpenAI Python SDK for API integration
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations

**TR-2: API Integration**
- Use OpenAI responses endpoint with DeepResearch models
- Implement proper prompt engineering using input parameters
- Handle long-running research operations (5-20 minutes typical)

**TR-3: MCP Compliance**
- Follow MCP protocol specifications
- Implement proper tool registration and execution
- Use type hints and docstrings for automatic tool definition

**TR-4: Security & Authentication**
- Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- No credential logging or exposure
- Input validation for all parameters

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Performance**
- Research completion time: 5-20 minutes (OpenAI-dependent)
- Server startup time: < 5 seconds
- Memory usage: < 100MB baseline

**NFR-2: Reliability**
- Handle API timeouts gracefully
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Clear error messages for debugging

**NFR-3: Usability**
- Simple JSON configuration
- Clear parameter documentation
- Intuitive error messages

**NFR-4: Cost Efficiency**
- Estimated $2-5 per research request (OpenAI pricing)
- No caching to avoid storage costs
- Efficient API usage patterns

### Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly excluded from v1.0:
- Research result caching or storage
